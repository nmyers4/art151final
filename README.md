## 90's Childhood - Neil Myers - 2021
This piece is my attempt to emulate the audio-visuals in media that I experienced as child and the feelings that I now experience thinking back on that time. As a child, video games were very impactful to me and most certainly shaped my growing brain and how I thought about the world. Many of those video game experiences are so vivid that I can use them as sort of memory guideposts in remembering what else was going on in my life during each new video game release. This is also a sort-of homage to the mid to late nineties fan sites that were becoming very popular at time, in particular fan sites and walkthrough sites for video games.
